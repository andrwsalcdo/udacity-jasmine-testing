## Overview

This is the final project in Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. The purpose is to learn the standard of development known as "test-driven development".
You are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I used [Jasmine 2.2.0](https://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction) to write a number of tests against the
business logic of the pre-existing application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

Project was evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/18/view)
